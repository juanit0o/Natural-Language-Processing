# Natural-Language-Processing
NLP project divided into 3 parts (incremental). Main goal was to match patients descriptions (unstructured text written in english) with clinical trials descriptions (also written in english). Everything is thoroughly explained in the reports.

The 3 parts correspond to the techniques used to do this:
- 1st part was done using the Vector Space Model and the language model with Jelinek-Mercer Smoothing (LMJM).
- 2nd part was done using the LETOR model (combining VSM and LMJM with the individual text fields)
- 3rd part was done using transformers (using the BERT Model)
